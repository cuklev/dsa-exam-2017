# Beers

## Description

Coki loves numbers. He also loves beer.

His evil-genious twin Koci, deserted him in a desert. He also left some beers, so Coki can refresh himself.

You can think of the desert as a rectangular field with size `NxM`.
- On any of the cells, there can be a stack of beers.
- Coki can move to a next cell and only in 4 directions
  - Top, left, right and bottom
- Each move of Coki takes him 1 time
- Each stack of beers refreshes Coki with exactly 5 time
- Coki always starts from the top-left corner and the exit is always on the bottom right corner

Help Coki to reach the exit as fast as possible!


## Input

Read from the standard input

- On the first line are the numbers `N`, `M` and `B`
  - `N` and `M` are the dimensions of the field
  - `B` is the number of stacks of beers
- On the next `B` lines find the coordinates of the stacks of beer

## Output

Print to the standard output

- On the single line of the output, print the minimal time it takes Coki to reach the exit
