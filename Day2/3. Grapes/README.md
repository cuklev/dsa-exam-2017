# Grapes

## Description

Steve has reached a conclusion. He needs to eat more fruit. But what type of fruit does he like? He makes his own genetically modified grape which looked more like binary trees (see picture below).

![Grape](./imgs/grape.png)

His grapes are somewhat limited, so he calls them \*rapes.
**N**-rape fruit is genetically modified grape with **N** amount of \*rapes.

Write a program which find the number of possible **N**-rape fruit configurations for a given value of **N**.

## Input
- Input is read from the console
  - A number **N** is read from the first line

## Output
- Output should be printed on the console
  - Print the answer on a single line

## Constraints
- 0 <= **N** <= 1000
- **See BGcoder for time and memory limits**
